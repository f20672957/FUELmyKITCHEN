          <div class="column">
            <li>
              <span>CRANBERRIES</span>: Fresh cranberries work best in this
              recipe, and are easy to find in November and December in your
              local grocery store. If all you have on hand is frozen
              cranberries, you can use those.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <span>ORANGE ZEST</span>: We will not be using the orange flesh
              for this cranberry cake, just the zest. You want to be a little
              picky when picking out your orange, look for one that is
              relatively thick-skinned and firm to the touch. If you can, go
              organic.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <span>ALMONDS</span>: You can get a bag of sliced almonds at the
              store for this recipe, or if you have a food processor, you can
              easily make chopped almonds to sprinkle on top. Just pulse some
              raw almonds until they are finely chopped. This will add nice
              texture contrast to the cake.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <span>POWDERED SUGAR</span>: A light dusting of powdered sugar is
              the perfect finishing touch to this cake. You do not want to go
              too crazy with it, or it may become too sweet.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <span>DRY INGREDIENTS</span>: All-purpose flour is a great choice
              for this cranberry pound cake. You could also use whole wheat or
              white whole wheat flour as an alternative. You will also need
              baking powder, baking soda, and salt to help the cake rise and
              offer flavor balance. Cane sugar and a pinch of cinnamon will also
              be added to this dry mixture.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <span>WET INGREDIENTS</span>: This cranberry cake also needs some
              butter, Greek yogurt in place of milk, and eggs. The Greek yogurt
              helps keep the cake moist, while the butter adds richness to it.
              Some vanilla extract to punch up the flavor and give the cranberry
              cake some vanilla undertones.

            <li>
              <span>STEP ONE</span>: In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle
              attachment, cream together the butter, and sugar for 3-5 minutes
              or until combined, scraping down the sides as needed.
            </li>
            <br /><br />
            <li>
              <span>STEP TWO</span>: Add the eggs one at a time and the vanilla
              extract. Add the Greek yogurt and orange zest until just mixed.
            </li>
            <br /><br />
            <li>
              <span>STEP THREE</span>: Slowly add the flour mixture, allowing
              some to fully mix in before adding the next.

            <br /><br />
            <li>
              <span>STEP FOUR</span>: Once the flour is incorporated and the

              sliced almonds.
            </li>
            <br /><br />
            <li>
              <span>STEP FIVE</span>: Preheat the oven to 350°F. and grease an
              8-inch round baking pan with butter then transfer the batter to
              the prepared baking dish and spread it out evenly, so it reaches
              the sides of the pan. Sprinkle the remaining sliced almonds on
              top.
            </li>
            <br /><br />
            <li>
              <span>STEP SIX</span>: Bake for 45-50 minutes until the cake is
              cooked through in the center. Let cool before serving.
            </li>
            <br /><br /><br />
            <li>
              <span>N.B.</span> To keep the cranberry cake from crumbling, let
              it cool completely before slicing. This allows the cake to rest
              and finish setting up.

            <li>
              <span>DO NOT THAW FROZEN CRANBERRIES</span>. This recipe works
              well with fresh or frozen cranberries. If you want to use frozen
              ones, there is no need to thaw. That way, they will not bleed into
              the cake batter and turn it pink.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <span>FOLD DRY INGREDIENTS INTO THE WET INGREDIENTS</span>. For
              best results when making a cranberry pound cake, it is important
              to gently fold the wet and dry ingredients together. This will
              help prevent overmixing and ensure that the cake stays tender and
              moist.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <span>WHEN ZESTING, AVOID THE WHITE</span>. Be sure to only get
              the orange peel and not the white pith, as that can add a bitter
              taste to your sauce.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <span>LET THE CAKE COOL COMPLETELY BEFORE SLICING</span>. Be sure
              to let your cranberry almond cake fully cool before slicing and
              serving so that it holds together well. If you slice and serve
              while the cake is still warm, it may fall apart.

                <span>USE LEMON INSTEAD OF ORANGE ZEST</span>. If you do not

                profile, consider using lemon zest instead. This will give your

              <h3>HOW TO STORE AND REHEAT CRANBERRY CAKE?</h3>
              <p>
                To store your cranberry pound cake, let it cool completely
                before transferring to an airtight container. This will help
                prevent the cake from drying out or becoming stale. You can keep
                your cake at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the fridge
                for a longer shelf life. To reheat your cranberry cake, preheat
                the oven to 350°F. then, place the cake on a baking sheet and
                pop it into the oven for 5-10 minutes, or until warm throughout.
                Alternatively, you can reheat individual slices in the microwave
                on medium power for 30-60 seconds, depending on the desired
                level of warmth. Be sure to check that your cake is not getting
                too hot or drying out, as you do not want to damage the delicate
                sponge.

              <p>

              <h3>CAN I FREEZE CRANBERRY CAKE?</h3>
              <p>
                Yes, you can freeze cranberry pound cake. To do so, let the cake
                cool completely and then slice it into individual servings.
                Place the slices on a baking sheet in the freezer until they are
                firm. Then, transfer them to an airtight container or freezer
                bag and store them for up to 3 months. When ready to serve, let
                the cake thaw at room temperature for a few hours, or place it
                in the fridge overnight. Alternatively, you can freeze it whole.
                To do so, wrap the cake tightly in several layers of plastic
                wrap and place it in an airtight container. You can store your
                whole cranberry pound cake in the freezer for up to 3 months.

                slicing and serving.
