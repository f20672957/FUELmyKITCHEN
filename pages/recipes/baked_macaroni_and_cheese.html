              This easy baked macaroni and cheese is topped with panko bread
              crumbs. It is also made with gruyere and cheddar cheese with a
              little tang from dijon mustard and then baked, creating a creamy
              sensation from the inside with a crunchy crust on the top. In
              addition, it is quick and easy enough to serve as a weeknight
              meal. This is one cheesy side dish and a real crowd-pleaser.
              Kid-friendly and made from scratch! <br />

            <h3>WHY YOU WILL LOVE THIS RECIPE:</h3>
            <li>
              <span>THERE IS NOTHING QUITE LIKE HOMEMADE MACARONI & CHEESE</span
              >. Sure, you could just use a box mix and top it with bread
              crumbs, but this version is truly worth the little bit of extra
              effort. The combination of gruyere, cheddar, and dijon mustard
              adds depth to the cheese sauce and makes it so creamy and
              delicious!
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <span>BREAD CRUMB TOPPING</span>. It adds a crunchy texture to
              each bite of macaroni and cheese, taking it to the next level!
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <span>QUICK & EASY WEEKNIGHT MEAL</span>. This recipe is ready in
              just about 45 minutes and can easily be a main dish served with a
              salad or veggie side dish, or serve as a delicious side to your
              favorite protein!
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <span>KID-FRIENDLY, BUT STILL LOVED BY ADULTS</span>. Macaroni and
              cheese is a staple for kids (and let us be honest, adults too!),
              and adding in the bread crumb topping takes it up a notch without
              compromising on taste for those picky eaters. Plus, it is made
              from scratch, so you know exactly what goes into it!

          <div class="column">
            <li>
              <span>ELBOW MACARONI</span>: Elbow macaroni is the quintessential
              pasta shape used in macaroni and cheese. However, feel free to use
              a different shape, just make sure to adjust the cooking time
              according to the box instructions.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <span>BREAD CRUMBS</span>: The bread crumb topping adds texture to
              each bite and an irresistible crunch. If you do not have panko on
              hand, try homemade bread crumbs or crushed-up butter crackers.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <span>GRUYERE & CHEDDAR CHEESE</span>: Both of these cheeses have
              a strong, sharp flavor that adds depth to the creamy cheese sauce.
              Gruyere adds a nuttiness and depth of flavor, while the cheddar
              adds that classic macaroni and cheese taste we all know and love.
              Grate them yourself for the best results.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <span>DIJON MUSTARD</span>: A little bit of dijon adds the perfect
              tang and depth to the cheese sauce. Do not omit this ingredient.
              It really takes the flavor up a notch.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <span>ROUX</span>: The roux is the base of your creamy cheese
              sauce. It is made with flour and butter, which helps thicken the
              sauce and adds a richness from the butter. Milk is incorporated to
              create a creamy sauce. Whole milk adds the most creaminess, but
              feel free to use a lower fat milk if preferred.

              season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring the mixture to a boil,
              then reduce to low and simmer for 5-7 minutes, occasionally
              whisking until sauce is thickened.

              and Butter an 8 x 11-inch baking dish and set aside. Moreover, in
              a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the pasta al dente
              according to package instructions. Drain, rinse and set aside to
              cool.

            <br />
            <li>
              <span>STEP SIX</span>: Once the pasta becomes fully combined in
              the sauce, transfer to the prepared baking dish and sprinkle with
              panko breadcrumbs. Bake for 20-25 minutes until the breadcrumbs
              are golden and the edges are bubbly,

              <span
                >COOK PASTA AL DENTE FOR TWO MINUTES SHY OF THE RECOMMENDED
                COOKING TIME</span
              >. You want the pasta to be slightly undercooked because it is
              going to continue to bake in the sauce and in the oven. If you
              overcook it on the stovetop beforehand, it will likely get too
              mushy and break apart while baking.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <span>COOL THE PASTA BEFORE TOSSING IT IN THE SAUCE</span>.
              Normally we want to coat the warm pasta in whatever sauce we are
              making immediately. But doing so for baked macaroni and cheese can
              cause the elbow macaroni to absorb too much of the sauce and make
              it soggy after cooking. It is a good idea to rinse the pasta after
              cooking, drain and allow it to cool while you are making the
              sauce.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <span>GRATE YOUR OWN CHEESE FOR THE CHEESE SAUCE</span>.
              Store-bought shredded cheese is convenient and works well for
              topping the macaroni and cheese. However, it does not work well
              for the cheese sauce because it has anti-caking agents, which can
              prevent the cheese from melting efficiently and sticking together
              in the sauce. Also, it can sometimes have a powder residue or
              grainy texture from those caking agents.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <span>USE PANKO BREAD CRUMBS FOR TOPPING IF AVAILABLE</span>.
              Using regular bread crumbs works just fine too. However, panko
              bread crumbs give that extra crunchy taste.

                cheese and adds a delicious nutty flavor, but feel free to mix
                in some other cheeses like sharp white cheddar, gouda, fontina,
                or even some blue cheese.

              <li>
                <span>TRY DIFFERENT TYPES OF PASTA</span>. Elbow macaroni is
                classic, but you can also use shells, cavatappi, or even
                spiralized veggie noodles for a healthier option. Just make sure
                to adjust the cooking time accordingly for the type of pasta you
                use.

                <span>ADD IN SOME EXTRA PROTEIN OR VEGETABLES</span>. Cooked
                ground beef, turkey, or even chicken goes great with macaroni
                and cheese. Or add in some sautéed broccoli, mushrooms, or
                peppers for a bit of added nutrition. Just make sure to cook
                them beforehand before adding them to the macaroni and cheese.

                pepper to add extra flavor to the bread crumb topping.

              <h3>HOW TO STORE AND REHEAT BAKED MACARONI & CHEESE?</h3>
              <p>
                Leftovers can be stored in the fridge, in an airtight container,
                or covered with foil. To reheat, place macaroni and cheese in a
                baking dish and cover with aluminum foil. Heat at 350°F. for 20
                minutes or until warmed through. You can also microwave
                individual portions for 1-2 minutes, until warm.

                WHAT IS THE BEST TYPE OF CHEESE FOR THIS BAKED MACARONI &
                CHEESE?
              </h3>
              <p>
                This comes down to your preference. But generally, most recipes
                will have 2-3 types of cheese. Sharp cheddar and Gruyere is a
                very popular combination. You can make this with white cheddar,
                mild cheddar, or medium cheddar. If you can not find Gruyere,
                Jarlsberg Swiss cheese or regular swiss cheese works well. If
                you want to throw in a third cheese into the mix, it is highly
                recommended you use Raclette cheese, which is super melty and
                practically made for macaroni and cheese.

              <h3>HOW LONG WILL BAKED MACARONI & CHEESE LAST IN THE FRIDGE?</h3>
              <p>
                Leftovers can last in the fridge for up to 4 days. It is best to
                eat it within 2-3 days for the freshest and tastiest results.

              <h3>CAN I FREEZE BAKED MACARONI & CHEESE?</h3>
              <p>
                Freezing this macaroni and cheese recipe is not recommended.
                Since we are making everything from scratch, it is possible that
                the milk with separate or the pasta can become mushy when thawed
                and reheated. It is best to just make and enjoy within a few
                days.
